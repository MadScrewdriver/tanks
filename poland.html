								The TK (also known as the TK-3) tankette was a Polish design produced from 1931 based on 
								the chassis of the British Carden Loyd tankette, with an improved hull and more powerful engine,
								and armour up to 8 mm (0.31 in) thick (10 mm or 0.39 in on the TKS). In 1939, up-arming of the 
								tankettes with Nkm wz.38 FK 20 mm (0.79 in) machine guns began, but only 24 of these were 
								completed before the outbreak of World War II.
								On 6 November 1934 Estonia purchased 6 vehicles from Poland, with the contract deal worth over 180,000 krones.
								The deal also included one additional tracked-lorry, and a motorcycle was 
								given free as a bonus. After the Soviet Union occupied Estonia, these vehicles were put into service with the Red Army.
